- How we build?
* we have three main devs - 
Anshu, Neha, Pranav

These three devs are supposed to build their own modules based on the feature they are working on
Majorly these will be - Login Pages(one single page that asks if a user is new or old or admin)
    Sign Up page(user mail/phone/both, passoword, re-enter pass, check if passes match and then save to database)
    Sign in page(enter mail/mobile, paassword)
    Admin(View/Edit Items, View users, edit users, signout, view all bills)

    - Orderings Items - first logged in account will be connected to this page for the user and then they shall be asked if they want to order news items or review their previous bills
                        then they will be allowed to go through
