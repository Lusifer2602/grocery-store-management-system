Here's a list of all the benifits you are gonna get from working on this project

For Devs:
You'll learn how several parts of a technology work in building an app - 
Learn system architecture (for CLI, GUI, Web based platforms)
python(with several libs applied to the app), sql, html, css, js, htmx, deployment, server handling, encryption, framework, encryption, data management
If shit goes well we might as well develop a cross platform for mobile

For Manager:
You'll learn what it is like to work in team and manage them
How to assign and track a bunch of tasks efficiently without creating a mess
how to resolve conflicts between team if situation arises
how to keep track of when a task was done and by whom
to handle all the devs in an organised manner so the entire shit doesn't collapse on its face
