CLI update
we were going the functional programming approach but it turns out I had forgotten you can't store values inside a function outside of it
Earlier we were thinking we could just create functions for each step and call them one by one but it turns out this is not the case (BECAUSE I FUCKING FORGOT)
So as it turns out i will now be coding the entire shit into one file without calling functions for each part, I wish that was a thing but anyways lol
